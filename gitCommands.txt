Initialize a repository(.git) -> git init
.git is hidden.

open .git -> to open .git repository(info related to project history is stored here)
rm -rf .git ->  to remove .git repo.

echo hello > file1.txt --> creates a new file with content "hello".
git status -> The git status command is used to display the 
state of the repository and staging area. It
allows us to see the tracked, untracked files and changes.

git add file1.txt file2.txt ->  add both files to the staging area.
git add *.txt -> add all(.txt) uncommitted files to the staging area.
git add . -> for all files.

add command needs to be run everytime a file is modified and the 
changes needs to be saved to the staging area.

echo world >> file1.txt ---> append "world" to file1.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit."

Best practices: 
1. Commits should not be too small(everytime updating the 
file and then commit) and not too large(implementing 
everything and then commit).
2. Each commit should represent logically separated change set.
